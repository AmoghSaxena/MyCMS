# Pre-Installation Process

> ## Step 1 - Edit the docker compose file.

* Open `docker-compose.yaml`.
* You can change the port `8086` to whatever you want 
* You can also change `ADMIN_USER`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - But as we are testing it in local lets leave it as it is.


> ## Step 2 - Edit the `smtp.json` file for mailing purpose.

* To change the configurations please check [SMTP Config](smtp.md) page
